Presentations and Course Material from http://webdatanet.cbs.dk/ in Greece

The first presentation is also available on Rpubs.com where it can be directly viewed in the browser: http://rpubs.com/mbannert/32266 , also my rpubs profile offers other basic R presentation from a course in taught in Constance: http://rpubs.com/mbannert/



## Useful R Resources
Since I have been asked a lot of basic and not-so-basic R questions during various sessions during my stay I decided to update the presentation with a couple of my favorite R resources. 

Also here's the example on indexing and performance improvement over loops I promised to put up: https://gist.github.com/mbannert/e62079c55a493e7c6668 


### Online
**CRAN Task Views**: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/
R packages explained/monitored by domain / field of research. 

**Introduction to R**: http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf
An official intro, basic, R-ish. 


**Hadley Wickham: Advanced R Programming**: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/
As the name suggests this is not a basic introduction, but his tutorials are always a good read: on point, layouted and designed very well. Particularly Functional Programming is very interesting in motivating to learn more R. 

**Hadley Wickham**: ggplot2 documentation â€“ docs.ggplot2.org/current/
Advanced Plotting for R implenting a layer-by-layer concept, see also Grammar of Graphics.

### Offline: 
**Norman Matloff: The Art of R Programming**
One the last R books that remains worth reading with all the great online resources.
