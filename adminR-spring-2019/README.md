# adminR spring meetup 2019 - slides

## R in Production

The slides were created with Google Slides using the Google slides API. 
I've used the node module [md2googleslides](https://github.com/gsuitedevs/md2googleslides) for the basic creation. Thanks for this great piece of software to all contributors! 

A .pdf version can also be found in this repository.
